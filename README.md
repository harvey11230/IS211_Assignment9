I am good with the football_stats.py because I can use the attributes to extract the value.

apple_stock.py - unable to get the html from https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/historical.

nfl_spreads.py - I tried to find all the td tag, but I didn't get desire result to extract the value. I expect to get a standard answer for learning.
